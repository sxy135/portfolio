									<p>
                                    Colorful Memory is a cognition training device for old people, especially for those who are in the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) stage. It could perform cognition training through a delightful game which requires old people to memorize the color sequence as well as to move their bodies to tap the lights. Therefore, the risk of developing into Alzheimer's Disease (AD) will be largely reduced. 
                                    </p>

                                    <strong>Type :</strong> &nbsp;A group project for the China-Us Young Maker Competition <br />
                                    <strong>My Role :</strong> &nbsp; UX Design, Literature Review, Software Development <br />
                                    <strong>Timeline :</strong> &nbsp; 2016/06/17-2016/06/19 <br />
                                     <strong>Award :</strong> &nbsp; The first prize of China-Us Young Maker Competition, Shanghai<br />
                                    </p>

									<h2>Background Information</h2>
                                    <p>We made this device in a 48-hour maker competition. We chose to design a cognition training device because two of our teammates' grandfathers suffered from Alzheimer's Disease, so we wanted to help our families with our knowledge and skills.</p>
									<p>Nowadays, the aging of population has become a serious problem. While China's population is aging at unprecedented levels. Statistical figure shows that there are more than <strong>127 million</strong> old people all over the world.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the <strong>4th</strong> fatal disease among old people.</p>
                                    <span class="image main"><img src="images/memory/02.PNG" alt="" /></span>
                                    <span class="image main"><img src="images/memory/03.PNG" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Since the present medical technology can not cure AD,
the MCI period is the <strong>best time</strong> to apply the therapeutic interventions in order to slow the progression of AD.<br/>
									But the main treatments now still have many problems.
                                    </p>
                                    <span class="image main"><img src="images/memory/04.PNG" alt="" /></span>
                                    <p>Apart from the side-effects or being too boring, these treatments make the old people with MCI feel they are patients while the patients are generally reluctant to be recongized as patients. As a consequence, we chose to design a device that would be suitable for all the old people instead of especially for people who suffer from MCI.</p>

									<h2>Brainstorm</h2>
                                    <p>We went through several rounds of brainstorm to figure out what kind of product would help old people in the most delightful way. Finally we decided to combine body movement and memorizing color sequence together in that colors are the most common and most basic information for people to memorize. 
                                    </p>

									<h2>Product Design & Interaction Design</h2>
                                    <p>Considering that old people tend to have weak eyesight and they are generally not interested in digital devices we decided to create an interaction device without digital screens.</p>
									<p>We got inspirations from the traditional Chinese drums. The interaction mode developed from the way of beating drums. <br />
                                    The movement in this game is aimed at training their limbs.
The position of the separate parts are carefully designed to ensure the safety as well as the training intensity.</p>

                                    <p>Then we tried to define the user flow as below. </p>
                                    <span class="image main"><img src="images/memory/userflow.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                                    <p>From this, we developed the game logic for our software architecture.</p>
                                    <span class="image main"><img src="images/memory/logic.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                    <hr class="major" />
                                    <h2>Development</h2>
                                    <p>We used the Arduino101 Development Board and also other modules like the pressure sensor, vibration sensor, RGB LED
and so on. Our aim is to achieve the most sophisticated function by using the most foundmental hardware.  <br />
                                    As for software architecture, we use finite state machine to implement the game logic to make it more extendable.</p>
                                    <span class="image main"><img src="images/memory/07.PNG" alt="" /></span>


                                    
                                    
                                    <hr class="major" />
                                    <h2>Prototype</h2>
                                    <span class="image main"><img src="images/memory/p1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                                    
                                     <hr class="major" />
                                    <h2>Product Extension</h2>
                                    <p>
                                    The device could be placed at the rehabilitation center, community square, the park and so forth. And the product could also be extended to the field of child cognition training.
<br />
                                    We could add PK mode and other interesting incentive mechanism to encourage more people to take part in the game. <br />
                                    Besides,the device could be connected to intelligent wearable device to get more accurate data. <br />
